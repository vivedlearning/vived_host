/**
 * VivedAPI Use Cases Index
 *
 * This module exports all use case classes for the VivedAPI feature.
 * Use cases contain the business logic for API operations and coordinate
 * between entities, external services, and user interface components.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Use cases implement specific API operations and workflows
 * - They coordinate between entities, HTTP requests, and authentication
 * - Each UC handles validation, error management, and API communication
 * - Some UCs manage singleton operations, others handle per-request workflows
 * - UCs provide clean interfaces for controllers and other components
 *
 * Available Use Cases:
 * - HTTP Operations: BasicFetchUC, JsonRequestUC, BlobRequestUC
 * - Authentication: SignedAuthTokenUC, UserAuthUC
 * - File Management: FileUploadUC, FetchAssetFileFromAPIUC, PatchAssetFileUC
 * - Asset Operations: PostNewAssetUC, DeleteAssetOnAPIUC, GetAssetsForOwnerFromAPIUC
 * - Asset Metadata: FetchAssetMetaFromAPIUC, PatchAssetMetaUC, PatchAssetIsArchivedUC
 * - App Management: GetAppFromAPIUC
 * - Asset Updates: PatchAssetUC
