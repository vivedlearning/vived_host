/**
 * VivedAPI Controllers Index
 * 
 * This module exports all controller functions for the VivedAPI feature.
 * Controllers handle user input and coordinate operations between UI components
 * and the underlying business logic components.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Controllers provide simple function interfaces for common operations
 * - They validate inputs and handle error cases appropriately
 * - Controllers coordinate between use cases, entities, and external systems
 * - They serve as the primary interface for UI framework integration
 * - Error handling and logging are managed at the controller level
 * 
 * Available Controllers:
 * - User Authentication: loginUser, logoutUser, refreshAuthenticatedUser
 * - API Configuration: setApiStage
