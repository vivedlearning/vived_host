/**
 * VivedAPI Feature Index
 *
 * This module serves as the main entry point for the VivedAPI feature, providing
 * centralized access to all API-related components and functionality.
 *
 * The VivedAPI feature handles communication with VIVED backend services,
 * including authentication, asset management, and application data synchronization.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Provides unified API communication infrastructure for the host application
 * - Manages authentication tokens and user sessions
 * - Handles file uploads, downloads, and asset operations
 * - Supports multiple API environments (Production, Staging, Development, Local)
 * - Implements clean architecture patterns with separation of concerns
 *
 * Architecture Components:
 * - Entities: Core business objects for API configuration and state management
 * - Use Cases: Business logic for API operations and workflows
 * - Presentation Managers: Bridge between domain logic and UI components
 * - Controllers: Handle user inputs and coordinate feature operations
 * - Adapters: Interface with external UI frameworks and libraries
 * - Factories: Component creation and feature setup utilities
 * - Mocks: Test doubles for development and testing scenarios
