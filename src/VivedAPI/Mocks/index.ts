/**
 * VivedAPI Mocks Index
 *
 * This module exports all mock implementations for the VivedAPI feature.
 * Mocks provide test doubles and stub implementations for development and testing
 * scenarios where real API communication is not desired or available.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Mocks implement the same interfaces as production components
 * - They provide predictable, controllable behavior for testing
 * - Mocks can simulate various success and failure scenarios
 * - They enable development without requiring live API connections
 * - Mock implementations support isolated unit testing
 *
 * Available Mock Components:
 * - Presentation Manager Mocks: ApiStagePMMock, UserTokenPMMock
 * - HTTP Request Mocks: MockBasicFetchUC, MockJsonRequestUC, MockBlobRequestUC
 * - Authentication Mocks: MockSignedAuthToken, MockUserLoginUC
 * - File Operation Mocks: MockFileUpload, MockFetchAssetFileFromAPIUC, MockPatchAssetFileUC
 * - Asset Management Mocks: MockPostNewAssetUC, MockDeleteAssetOnAPIUC, MockGetAssetsForOwnerUC
 * - Asset Metadata Mocks: MockFetchAssetMetaFromAPIUC, MockPatchAssetMetaUC, MockPatchAssetIsArchivedUC
 * - App Management Mocks: MockGetAppFromAPIUC
 * - Asset Update Mocks: MockPatchAssetUC
