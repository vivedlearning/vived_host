/**
 * VivedAPI Presentation Managers Index
 * 
 * This module exports all presentation manager classes for the VivedAPI feature.
 * Presentation managers bridge the gap between domain entities and user interface
 * components, providing view model management and change notification systems.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - PMs extend AppObjectPM and manage view state for specific domain concepts
 * - They observe entity changes and update connected UI components
 * - PMs provide value comparison logic for efficient view update optimization
 * - They handle the conversion between domain models and view models
 * - PMs implement observer patterns for reactive UI updates
 * 
 * Available Presentation Managers:
 * - ApiStagePM: Manages view state for API environment configuration
 * - UserTokenPM: Manages view state for user authentication token display
