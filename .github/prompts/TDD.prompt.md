# Test Driven Development Workflow

## Step 1: Write a failing test
 - Write a test that will fail
 - Avoid mocking the script you are testing

## Step 2: Run failing test
- Run the test and confirm it fails
- Do not try to implement a fix yet

## Step 3: Commit
- Prompt me to keep the changes and commit them

## Step 4: Write the code
- Write the code so that the tests pass
- Do not modify the test code
- Run the test
- Keep iterating until the test passes
