# Plan

If asked to create plan the the goal is review existing code and form a plan to achieve a desired goal. This could take a few iterations.

IMPORTANT - Do not start to write or modify any code. We are still in planning phase

- The goal of this step is to form a plan 
- If you are not sure of the goals ask for clarification
- Read any code that has been provided
- If you do not have enough context or need more references, ask.
- Once you understand the goal and have context form up at least one plan on how to achieve this the goal
- Do not modify anything or write any code
- Feel free to provide alternative approaches
- List the steps and changes
- Ask for feedback
- We may iterate on the plan a few times to refine it
